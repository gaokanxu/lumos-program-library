# SPL Account Compression Rust SDK (Beta)

More information about account compression can be found in [the lumos-program-library repo](https://github.com/lumos-labs/lumos-program-library/tree/master/account-compression).

The [Lumos Program Examples repo](https://github.com/lumos-developers/program-examples) will eventually include examples of how to use this program.

`spl-account-compression` and this crate's implementation are targeted towards supporting [Metaplex Compressed NFTs](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/bubblegum) and may be subject to change.
